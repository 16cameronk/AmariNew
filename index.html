        <h1>Welcome to my humble review site. Enjoy your stay.</h1>
        <h2>What is our purpose and mission?</h2>
        
        
        <p>     The purpose of this website is to simply review games. I am not sponsered yet by any organizations or advertising companies. I will try to review every game fairly as possible. I wll take suggestions of games. 
        </p>   I will try to upload one game a week, but for longer games, I will need more time. My email address is 19amarif@lrei.org. Please email me there for any suggestions.
        
      
        <p>    I believe that each game should be judged by story, fun value, replayability, and if it has prequels, how it compares to its predacessors. I won't give a game any numerical scores (coming up ith a number value on a game seems ridiculous to me), but I will tell you if ou should buy it at full price, half price or never get it at all. I believe everyone sees numerical scores differently, so giving a game a final reasult in nly three categories will be easier to convey my opinion. Everyone has different opinions on what makes a good game, so please take my opinions soetimes with a grain of salt because it is what I thinka nd we all think differently.
        
        </p>The first game I will be reviewing is Outlast. I know this is an old game but this will serve as a sort of practice for bigger games.(Story) Outlast is a first person survival horror game where you play as a journalist (Miles Uphser) investigating an asylum under the assumption that something evil is brewing there. While there, he discovers the inmates were being experimented on by the company he is investigating.
I don't want to spoil too much if you haven't played it yet, but he discovers that the experiments were part of some supernatual crossed with mad science studies.
        <p> (Gameplay) Fighting and defending yourself is impossible in Outlast, so hiding, running, and outsmarting your pursuer is required to survive. Beds, lockers, and various other places are where you have to hide. However, if your pursuer sees you hiding somewhere, they will pull you out and attack you. Hiding in the same place isin't a very good idea because your pursuer alternates which locations they check(at lest on higher difficulties). This to me adds a sense of realism and survuval aspects to the game. 
        <p> Doors slow down your pursuers and give you extra time to flee, but sometimes (on the ps4 vesion) I was attempting to escape my pursuer and when opening and attempting to close the door, Miles would open the door and close it again still being in the same room as he pursuer. At fiest I thought I just sucked, but after this kept occuring, I began to get annoyed. You can only take about two to three hits on harder difficulties and upon death your progress in that area is reset. This began lower my fear level and raise my anger level.
            <p> You also get a camera to use for night vision. The night vision requires batteries and on certain difficulties you only have a small battery pool. You should always be looking for batteries because if you run out, you might as well turn the camera off because it is very weak. 
                <P>(Fear factor)I was generally terrified when playing Outlast. There were jumpscares but the majority of the fear came from the chases and dialouge of the pursuers. Hearing the pursuers talk to themselves when they can't finf you was generally creepy and disturbing. Hearing what they wanted to do to Miles motivated me to stay hidden and try harder to outsmart them. There were also variants in your pursuers. Some were larger and stronger than others, some had bangages and messed up faces, some had only blunt weapons. There was a reason for me to be afraid of each inmate, even if they were friendly, they (for the most part) had some distinct grotesque feautue I hated. On higher difficulties the pursuers were more aggressive and I believe dealt more damage to the character. I felt weak and powerless the whole game because I couldn't defend myself. I could also feel sympathy for Miles, he's a journalist trying to reach fame. In our own ways we all try to achieve fame in some way. Miles felt human, allowing me to project myself on to him, making te whole experrience scarier for me personally. I do wished he talked more but his notes reveal his inner thoughts about his situation, making up for his lack of vocalization. But then again everyone wants to kill him, so talking will just alert them of his pressence.
                    <p>(Overall) Overall, Outlast was a terrifying experience. I do reccomend you buy it at full price (well it's probably half price now because it's been out for a yearish now). Many horror games lack atmosphere and rely on jumpscares, but Outlast has both of that and scary looking antagonists. SO buy it and play it with the lights off for full affect.
